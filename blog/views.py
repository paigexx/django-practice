# form lifecycle
# When a user visits a page containing a form, they send a GET request to the server. In this case, thereâ€™s no data entered in the form, so we just want to render the form and display it.

# When a user enters information and clicks the Submit button, a POST request, containing the data submitted with the form, is sent to the server. At this point, the data must be processed, and two things can happen:

# The form is valid, and the user is redirected to the next page.
# The form is invalid, and empty form is once again displayed. The user is back at step 1, and the process repeats.
